                        <h2>Policy work</h2>
                        <p>In June 2009, then-British prime minister Gordon Brown announced that Berners-Lee would work
                            with the UK government to help make data more open and accessible on the Web, building on
                            the work of the Power of Information Task Force.[48] Berners-Lee and Professor Nigel
                            Shadbolt are the two key figures behind data.gov.uk, a UK government project to open up
                            almost all data acquired for official purposes for free reuse. Commenting on the opening up
                            of Ordnance Survey data in April 2010, Berners-Lee said: "The changes signal a wider
                            cultural change in government based on an assumption that information should be in the
                            public domain unless there is a good reason not to—not the other way around." He went on to
                            say: "Greater openness, accountability and transparency in Government will give people
                            greater choice and make it easier for individuals to get more directly involved in issues
                            that matter to them.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee#Policy_work"

                        <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
                        <p>Berners-Lee has received many awards and honours. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II inthe
                            2004 New Year Honours "for services to the global development of the Internet", and was
                            invested formally on 16 July 2004.[18][19] On 13 June 2007, he was appointed to the Order of
                            Merit (OM), an order restricted to 24 (living) members.[68] Bestowing membership of the
                            Order of Merit is within the personal purview of the Queen and does not require
                            recommendation by ministers or the Prime Minister.<a
